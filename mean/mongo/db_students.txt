Create a database called 'my_first_db'. 
use my_first_db

Create students collection. Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}}) 
db.createCollection('students')

Create 5 students with the appropriate info. 
db.students.insert({name: "Bob Jones", home_state: "Illinois", lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 01, day: 26, year: 1983}})

Get all students. 
db.students.find().pretty()

Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo). 
db.students.find({ home_state: {$in: ["California", "Washington"] } } ).pretty();

Get all students whose lucky number is:
greater than 3   db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})
less than or equal to 10     db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})
between 1 and 9 (inclusive)    db.students.find({ lucky_number: {$gte: 1}, lucky_number: {$lte: 9}});
 
 Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.  
 db.students.update( {}, {$set: { interests: [ "coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"] }}, false, true )

 Add some unique interests for each particular students into each of their interest arrays. 
 db.students.update({name: "Krista Prokopczyk"}, {$push: {interests: 'snowboarding'}})


 Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array. 
db.students.update({name: "Amy Adams"}, {$push: {interests: 'taxes'}})

 Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added. 
db.students.update({name: "Amy Adams"}, {$pull: {interests: 'taxes'}})

 Remove all students who are from California (or Washington). 
db.students.remove({home_state: "California"})

 Remove a user by name.  
db.students.remove({name: "Joel Witmer"}
Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5} }, true) {}

Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
db.students.updateMany( {}, { $set: { number_of_belts: 0 } } );


Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.update( { home_state: "Washington" }, { $inc: { number_of_belts: 1 } } )

Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
db.students.updateMany( {}, { $rename: {number_of_belts: "belts_earned"} } )

Remove the 'lucky_number' field.
db.students.update( {}, {$unset: {lucky_number:1 }}, {multi: true})

Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
db.students.updateMany( {}, {$set: {updated_on: new Date() }} )
